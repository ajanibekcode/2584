# 2584

## Description

2584 is a recreation of the puzzle game 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli. The goal of the game is to merge tiles together until the user reaches a certain tile value. The game starts with two tiles randomly placed on the board with the user given the option to swipe in four different directions (left, right, up, down). By swiping, the user is able to merge tiles together only if specific conditions are met.

### Why 2584?

Instead of using the powers of 2, the game uses the Fibonacci sequence for the tiles. The goal for this game is for the user to reach the tile value of 2584. The only way to reach tile 2584 is to merge tiles together and the specific condition that must be met is the two tiles must be consecutive Fibonacci numbers that will create the next tile in the sequence. For example, Tile 1 and Tile 2 can merge into Tile 3, but Tile 1 and Tile 3 cannot merge into Tile 4 (4 is not in the sequence).
